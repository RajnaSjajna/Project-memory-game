##  How to Play

1. Click on two cards to find a matching pair.  
2. If the images match cards stay flipped.  
3. If they don’t match the cards automatically flip back after a short delay.  
4. The goal is to find all pairs before time runs out (50 seconds).  

5. When the time runs out, a “Time’s up!” message appears in the center and the game automatically resets.
